# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a **hands-on training course** for learning LangChain4j through progressive lab exercises. The repository is structured as a proper training course where students build functionality incrementally.

### Repository Structure

- **`main` branch**: Starter code with TODO-guided exercises for students
- **`solutions` branch**: Complete working implementations for reference
- **Test classes**: Contain TODO comments guiding students through implementation
- **Example classes**: Skeleton implementations with TODO instructions

The course demonstrates integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Java applications using the LangChain4j library (version 1.0.1), covering:

- Text generation and chat capabilities
- Structured data extraction  
- Prompt engineering with templates
- Chat memory for maintaining conversation context
- Vision capabilities for image understanding and generation
- Audio processing (text-to-speech and speech-to-text)
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with PDF and web content

## Common Commands

### Build and Run

```bash
# Build the project
./gradlew build

# Run example main classes directly (no application runner needed)
./gradlew run --main-class=com.kousenit.langchain4j.examples.BasicChatExample

# Run tests with environment variables
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key ./gradlew test
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests (many will be empty TODO stubs in main branch)
./gradlew test

# Run specific test classes (students implement these progressively)
./gradlew test --tests OpenAiChatTests
./gradlew test --tests AnthropicChatTests
./gradlew test --tests RAGTests

# Run individual test methods
./gradlew test --tests OpenAiChatTests.basicChat

# To see working tests, switch to solutions branch
git checkout solutions
./gradlew test
```

### Redis Setup (for RAG with Redis vector store)

```bash
# Start Redis Stack container
docker run -p 6379:6379 redis/redis-stack:latest
```

### Issue Management

```bash
# Create a new GitHub issue
gh issue create --title "Issue Title" --body "Issue description"

# List open issues
gh issue list

# Close an issue
gh issue close <issue-number>
```

**Important**: Always create GitHub issues for new features, major refactors, or bug fixes before starting work. This helps with project tracking and documentation.

**CRITICAL REMINDER**: Before implementing any significant changes or new features:
1. **CREATE** a GitHub issue first using `gh issue create`
2. **IMPLEMENT** the feature or fix
3. **CLOSE** the issue when complete using `gh issue close <number>`

This workflow ensures proper documentation and project tracking. Don't forget to close issues upon completion!

## Lab Implementation Workflow

Follow this established workflow when implementing each lab:

### 1. Create GitHub Issue
```bash
gh issue create --title "Lab X: [Lab Title]" --body "Implement Lab X exercises following the labs.md specification"
```

### 2. Create Feature Branch (from main)
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b labX-[descriptive-name]
```

### 3. Implement Starter Code (on feature branch)
- Create test class with TODO comments guiding students
- Include proper imports and basic structure
- Add comprehensive JavaDoc comments explaining each exercise
- Ensure tests fail gracefully with clear guidance

### 4. Merge to Main Branch
```bash
git checkout main
git merge labX-[descriptive-name]
git push origin main
```

### 5. Switch to Solutions Branch
```bash
git checkout solutions
git pull origin solutions
```

### 6. Implement Complete Solutions (on solutions branch)
- Replace all TODO comments with working implementations
- Ensure all tests pass with OPENAI_API_KEY set
- Include proper error handling and assertions
- Add detailed logging/output for educational value

### 7. Test and Commit Solutions
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key ./gradlew test --tests [TestClass]
git add .
git commit -m "Complete Lab X: [Lab Title] implementation

- Implement all working test methods
- Add proper error handling and assertions  
- Include educational logging and output
- All tests pass with valid API keys

Closes #[issue-number]

```

### 8. Push and Clean Up
```bash
git push origin solutions
git branch -d labX-[descriptive-name]  # Delete local feature branch
gh issue close [issue-number] --comment "Lab X implementation complete with starter code and solutions"
```

### 9. Verification Steps
- ‚úÖ Main branch has starter code with TODO comments
- ‚úÖ Solutions branch has complete working implementation
- ‚úÖ All tests pass on solutions branch
- ‚úÖ Feature branch deleted
- ‚úÖ GitHub issue closed
- ‚úÖ labs.md documentation matches implementation

**Important**: Always test solutions before committing. Use `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key ./gradlew test` to verify all tests pass.

## CRITICAL: Branch Management Guidelines

**‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER merge main branch into solutions branch without careful review!**

### Branch Purposes
- **`main` branch**: Starter code with TODO stubs for students
- **`solutions` branch**: Complete working implementations for reference

### Safe Merge Practices
1. **Before any merge**: Always check target branch has complete implementations
2. **Use selective merging**: Cherry-pick specific commits rather than full merges
3. **Documentation-only merges**: Only merge documentation/config changes, never test code
4. **Verify after merge**: Run tests to ensure solutions still work

### Emergency Recovery
If solutions are accidentally overwritten:
```bash
# Find the last good commit with complete implementations
git log --oneline solutions --grep="complete\|implement\|working"

# Restore specific files from earlier commit
git checkout <good-commit-hash> -- src/test/java/com/oreilly/springaicourse/
git checkout <good-commit-hash> -- src/main/java/com/oreilly/springaicourse/

# Commit the restoration
git commit -m "Restore complete implementations from backup"
```

**Remember**: Solutions branch should NEVER have TODO comments in test methods!

## Required Environment Variables

Set these environment variables before running tests and examples:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key  # Optional, for Claude exercises
```

## Common Tasks

### Adding Navigation to Exercise Files

To add a table of contents with navigable links to any tutorial/exercise file:

1. Add a table of contents section at the top like this:
```markdown
## Table of Contents

- [Exercise 1: Basic Setup](#exercise-1-basic-setup)
- [Exercise 2: Advanced Features](#exercise-2-advanced-features)
```

2. For IntelliJ IDEA compatibility, use standard Markdown heading anchors (headings automatically generate anchors based on their text)

3. Add return links at the end of each section:
```markdown
[‚Üë Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)
```

Note: The anchor names in the links should match the heading text (lowercase, with hyphens replacing spaces and special characters removed).

Example structure:
```markdown
## Table of Contents

- [Lab 1: Getting Started](#lab-1-getting-started)
- [Lab 2: Core Concepts](#lab-2-core-concepts)

## Lab 1: Getting Started

Content here...

[‚Üë Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

## Lab 2: Core Concepts

Content here...

[‚Üë Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)
```

This pattern is useful for any long tutorial or exercise file to improve navigation.

## Code Architecture

### Key Components

1. **AI Model Clients**
   - `ChatModel` - Primary interface for interacting with AI models (LangChain4j 1.0)
   - Model-specific implementations for OpenAI and Anthropic
   - Configured with builder patterns

2. **Memory and Tools**
   - `ChatMemory` - Maintains conversation history
   - `AiServices` - High-level interface for AI interactions
   - `@Tool` - Annotation for defining AI-callable functions

3. **RAG System**
   - `EmbeddingStore` - Stores document embeddings (In-memory or Redis)
   - Document loaders for various sources (PDF, web)
   - Text splitters for chunking documents
   - Embedding models for semantic search

4. **Content Handling**
   - `DocumentSplitter` - Splits documents into chunks
   - `ContentRetriever` - Retrieves relevant content for RAG
   - `ChatMemoryProvider` - Manages conversation state

5. **Configuration**
   - Builder patterns for all components
   - Environment variable-based configuration
   - No profiles needed - direct Java configuration

### Vector Store Implementation

The project supports multiple vector store implementations:

1. **In-Memory EmbeddingStore** (default)
   - Simple in-memory vector store
   - Good for development and testing

2. **Redis EmbeddingStore** 
   - Persistent vector store using Redis
   - Requires a running Redis Stack instance
   - Better for production use cases

## Training Course Structure

This is a **hands-on training course** where students implement LangChain4j functionality progressively:

### Learning Approach
- **Main branch**: Students start here with TODO-guided starter code
- **Solutions branch**: Complete implementations for reference
- **Progressive labs**: Each lab builds on previous knowledge
- **Hands-on implementation**: Students learn by coding, not copying

### Lab Progression
The course follows a structured progression documented in `labs.md`:
1. **Basic chat interactions** - Simple AI conversations
2. **Streaming responses** - Real-time AI communication
3. **Structured data extraction** - AI-powered data parsing
4. **Prompt engineering** - Template-based prompts
5. **Memory management** - Conversation context
6. **Vision and audio capabilities** - Multimodal AI
7. **RAG implementation** - Knowledge-augmented AI
8. **Vector store optimization** - Production-ready RAG with Redis

### Code Structure for Students
- **Test classes**: Contain TODO comments guiding implementation
- **Service classes**: Skeleton code with clear instructions
- **Working examples**: DateTimeTools, ActorFilms (students use these)
- **Reference implementations**: Available in solutions branch
